# daily-mail

This is a Python serverless function that retrieves a text file from Google Drive and emails it daily. Originally, I created it to send a random Zettelkasten note from my collection each day as a way to refresh my memory and revisit ideas.

The code is flexible and can be adapted to send other types of content as well. For example, I’ve used it to surprise friends and family with daily or weekly photos, curated memories, or personalized messages—creating a small, meaningful gift that brings back good times together.
