# daily-mail

Python code for a serverless function to grab a text file from the external drive (Google drive) and send it as an email daily. It was designed to send a random Zettelkasten note from my collection to me and anyone else who would like to receive it.

The code can be easily adapted to include photos, memories or dedicated texts which can be a nice present for someone. Surprising them with a curated content sent in a specified interval.
